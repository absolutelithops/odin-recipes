    <h2>Description</h2>

    <a>Try frosting these with a raspberry buttercream or other complementary flavor. It'll be difficult to eat just one!</a>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>5/8 cup milk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>3 3/4 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 egg whites, room temperature</li>
      <li>2 lemons, zested</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1.8 cups gluten-free flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>  
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
      <li>Whisk milk and lemon juice together in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, egg whites, lemon zest, and vanilla extract into milk mixture.</li>
      <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until batter is well mixed, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into lined cups to about 3/4-full.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are a light golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the muffin tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>  
    </ol>
